# 🪨 Rock, Paper, Scissors Game with Hand Gestures

This is a fun, computer vision-based version of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where you play against the computer using **hand gestures**. Built using **Python 3.8.10**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**.

---

## 📌 Features

- 👋 Play using real-time hand gesture recognition
- 🧠 AI opponent with random move generation
- 🔍 Accurate finger counting using MediaPipe Hand Tracking
- 🎥 Webcam-based real-time interaction with OpenCV

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8.10** (required for MediaPipe compatibility)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/)
- Random module (for computer's move)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-paper-scissors-hand-gesture.git
cd rock-paper-scissors-hand-gesture
````

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ✅ Make sure you're using **Python 3.8.10** — MediaPipe has limited compatibility with later versions.

## ▶️ How to Play

1. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Use your webcam to show:

   * ✊ Rock = 0 fingers
   * ✋ Paper = 5 fingers
   * ✌️ Scissors = 2 fingers
